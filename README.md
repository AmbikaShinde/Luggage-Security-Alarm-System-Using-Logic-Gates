# Luggage-Security-Alarm-System-Using-Logic-Gates
In this project we have built a circuit using an IC74LS00 which is a two input NAND gate along with some other components which is used to alert the user from a robbery. Here the buzzer produces a warning beep, when someone tries to unlock the lock as the alarm gets activated.
